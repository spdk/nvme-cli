      "message": "This doesn\u0027t seem right; we should be handling this inside the SPDK hook for the passthru IOCTL, not by modifying the parameters to the IOCTL.\n\nIn general, all of this magic stuff should go away if we just implement passthru by calling the NVMe library io_raw()/admin_raw() functions.  That would let us delete a bunch of unnecessary code as well.",

      "message": "Yes. nvme_spdk_submit_cmd_passthru() called the io_raw/admin_raw functions internally. Are you saying that there is no need to call the I/O public APIs? On the other hand, here it is to handle the zero based block count used in nvme-cli especially which is only meaningful nvme-cli scenario as our SPDK code itself is one based for this required block count.",
